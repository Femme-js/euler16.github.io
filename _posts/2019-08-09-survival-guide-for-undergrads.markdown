Its been a long time since my last blog. I have had a lot of exciting stuff happening in my life in between. I graduated, got my first full paper selected at a major AI conference, did an internship with Adobe's Media and Data Science Research team where I worked on a really exciting new field (more on that later) and went on a solo tour to my home state at the end of it. As I write this post I am travelling again, this time to Jaipur for a weekend. For a while now, I have been retrospecting about how these four years of undergraduate life have gone by. Overall its been a sweet cocktail of highs and lows and I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in college. But I still remember the feeling of uncertainity that plagued me when I was a fresher, the lost opportunities and mistakes (and blunders :-) ) committed due to lack of awareness about things related to undergraduate engineering. Now that I have finally left my college (and I also have some free time at my disposal), I think I can look back and examine my undergraduate years to derive some suggestions, cautions, advice etc. Things that I would tell a younger version of myself if I could go back in time. I summarize all of that in form of this **Survival Guide for Undergrads**.

## Disclaimer
I should make a few things clear in the begining.
1.  In no means is this guide complete. Part of the reason is that I don't think a full undergraduate experience can be distilled into a single blog post. So its totally possible that I have made some serious omissions (graduates! you are welcome to point that out to me on mail!!). Consequently I might add a stuff at a later date. 

2. The ideas presented in this blog are based around _my_ college experience and therefore would be biased in some way. As much as I would like to include an allround perspective, its simply humanly impossible for me to do so. Since I am a computer engineer by education, you might find this blog a bit 'CS-ish'. Additionally some sections of this post might not fit a non-Indian student's perspective.

3. Finally this is _my_ take on how to successfully wade through college life and certainly not the only one. You may very much disagree with my viewpoint and that is absolutely ok. But I hope you would find at least something that might be of use to you. 

> The post covers major issues faced throughout undergrad life such as internships, placements, MS preparation and Final year project. So even if you are not a fresher anymore, there are still somethings you will find useful. 

## How to approach your undergraduate life
Starting with your college journey can be overwhelming and it is quite natural to think of it that way. After all, when you emerge from the other end of undergrad life you would legally be an adult. The thought might be enough to spur you into worrying about your career, internships, placements (or whatever you think you want to do after college). Trust me this feeling is shared by most if not all freshers even if most wouldn't admit it. Here's what you should ideally be doing.

* **Relax and enjoy** : You have just entered college after a gruesome entrance preparation and you deserve a break. Don't worry about placements, internships at the onset. Trust me, anything you do in the name of preparation would be pretty insignificant in the larger scheme of things. So use this time to know the students joining with you make friends (as many as you can), go out and play etc. 

* **Explore! Explore! Explore!** : I can't stress this enough. Find out what hobby excites you the most. There would be time during your course where you would feel burnt out. Taking your mind off at that time and immersing yourself in something you like does a world of cut. Therefore you should try to identify some activity that refreshes you. It could be travelling around, going off for a stroll, painting or poetry. 

* **Start a blog** : Write something! Learning a new tech? share your learning journey in form of a blog. Visiting your village/hometown? write about it!. I think 'writing' is perhaps the most underrated intellectual activity. Writing forces you to sort, condense and solidify your ideas. The importance of this activity has been beautifully summarized by David McCullough, Pulitzer Prize winning author - 
> Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That's why it's so hard.

Apart from being an intellectual exercise, writing technical blogs is looked quite favourably in recruitment and in applications for higher education. You wil be surprised to know that most undergrad you will find writing down your ideas in a coherent and structured manner to be difficult. Making writing a coveted skill.

* **Ask** : It always helps to ask for advice/opinon from senior students in your college. Apart from getting time-tested solutions for your conundrum, you get an opportunity to make yourself 'known'. This is quite important because soon you will realise that opportunities won't just knock on your door. You will have to find them. It is not possible to be on the lookout for every such career chance on your own.  In such a scenario the network of seniors you build turns out to be the best medium for information. <br> However I should emphasize that although you should be ready to take input from as many people as you can, you need not attach equal importance to what everyone says. A simple rule of thumb is that the most useful advice/suggestion you will get will be from someone who has been in your position or the position you want to be in. Needless to say that although you should be permeable people's opnions, you should always evaluate other's opinions on merit before acting on them.


## Academics
* **Academic performance is important!** - 
    If there is one thing you must take away from this article then this is it! Whatever goals you want to end up pursuing, a good academic record is definitely a huge asset. Anyone making you think otherwise is either ignorant or your enemy :D . Yes you can argue that the current education system is broken or it is discourages innovation etc (and these arguments are have some merit) but at the end of the day people do look at your GPA. As far as  undergraduates are concerned, __GPAs do matter a lot__ !. The importance of GPA however wanes as you progress in your career. They matter less for students pursuing masters and very little for PhD candidates. So you can regard your scores/percentages as some pesky nuisance that you need to deal with before you graduate. It should be noted that when I emphasize the importance of GPA, there are two things I _don't_ imply :-
    1. poor academic record automatically leads to failure (in life).
    2. you need to be a department ranker to do something big.
    My point is that you should try to maintain your GPA above a certain threshold. Once above that threshold, people don't care about how much you score. A score below that however can make things harder. So how to score above that threshold?
    Well it depends on the individual. There is no standard, algorithmic way of doing x-y-z for getting good grades. You will have to come up with your own hacks. However I would highly recommend reading [this](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/advice.html) blog for a few pointers. <br/>



* **Engaging socially helps** - 
    Studies during undergraduate years is way different than what we do in high school. The main difference you will observe is that its difficult, in general, to maintain discipline in college academics vis-a-vis academics in school (specially if you are a hosteller!). Paradoxically this difference is not because of some fundamental changes in your mindset. Rather its due to your environment. You will find a plethora of activities that you would want to pursue, a less hands-on approach by the college admin as compared to your school teachers and even course syllabus would look a bit 'uncertain-ish'. For instance during my time at  NSIT it was not unusual to find last minute addition/reduction to exam topics. This deluge of possibilities can give rise to a sinking feeling.
    
    The best way to deal with this, is to be socially active! You will find that you get a lot more information about the course syllabus/ exams from your peers, seniors or through personal interaction from the professor than through official channels. Make it a point to reach out to your teachers personally regarding your coursework. They are more likely to explain a topic in detail or give you some important advice in a one on one discussion which they wouldn't feel like giving during a classroom lecture. All these little chats, though seemingly insignificant, lead to big differences when seen holistically.  <br/>

* **Be collaborative rather than competitive** -  
    While preparing for entrance exams we tend to get extrememely competitive. Well, college life will dorce you to shed that attitude. Your priority during these for years should be to find and achieve (or be on the path to achieve) what you want to do in life. Since life goals depend on personal preferences, it is stupid to be fiercely competitive. Working with others for mutual benefit is a skill that you should try to learn as soon as possible. Believe me effective collaboration is a rare phenomena. Mastering it would yield great dividends.

* **Do a project** <br/>
    Life in college is more than just getting marks. Five years down the line no one will care about how much you scored in your first semester examinations. What they will see is how skilled and passionate you are in your profession. Therefore getting real hands-on experience out of your curriculum is necessary. Read codebases of open source projects that you love. You will learn a lot more about software development than by reading theory. Start working on small personal projects of your own. Don't wait for learning the full stack required for that project before diving into it. You should learn while you develop. That's the most enjoyable and effective way to learn specially in case of computer science.

* **Result is not always proportional to effort**
    This is something that is deliberately neglected when we are in school. 'If you work hard you will always succeed' seems to be the moral of every other story that we read. The point is that these stories don't capture all the complexities of life. There are gazillion many random variables that are potent enough to ruin your result no matter how hard you have worked for it. Learn to deal with the fact that there will be moments when in spite of all your best efforts, you will end up being disappointed by the outcome. But mind it I am not telling you to stop doing your best and be a defeatist, resigning yourself to those random factors. On the contrary you should, apart from working hard, plan your efforts in a way that accounts for those random variables. This is analogous to how electrical engineers keep a tolerance band while designing circuit elements to prevent circuit failures when there is a sudden random spike in current.

## Undergraduate Research
Doing research during bachelor's degree is not necessary but is useful in my opinion. Research work requires you to develop a lot of skills, creativity, technical writing, logical thinking, programming to name a few. All these skills are useful in any profession. Therefore I would suggest that even if you are not looking to study further after obtaining your bachelor's degree, you should try working on at least one research project. It doesn't have to be anything fancy or groundbreaking. You could do a comparitive study of different algorithms used to solve a certain problem, analyse how an algorithm behaves when it gets some weird input or you could even write a paper on some project you worked on. Its not imperative for you to have it published in a big conference. You can simply put it on arxiv.org. The message is indulge in research to enhance the skills I mentioned above. And of course you do get bragging rights if you have a paper :).

**Expectations from undergraduate research** : People in general don't expect you to do something earth shattering from students pursuing their bachelor's degree. It would be exceptional if you manage to do so but you shouldn't be disappointed if the progress you make doesn't seem ground breaking. Remember great results are a culmination of years of scientific output. Therefore if you are working on a large problem and you manage to find a better solution to a small subproblem, don't be afraid to publish it. This has two advantages.
1. Doing so is **motivating**. Research takes time and it is quite common to lose interest in between. In such a situation nothing beats the happiness of paper acceptance.
2. It would help you get valuable feedback on the approach you are using to solve the larger/higher order problem. 

Ofcourse you should discuss the progress you have made with your advisor. This would help you avoid a situation in which you spend weeks writing a paper on something that is too trivial to be accepted in a reputed conference/journal.
<br>

**Keep a research journal** : Very often you will find that you can't just brainstorm research ideas out of the blue. It takes time. And even when they do come, they would arrive in bits and pieces. Therefore I would suggest you to keep a journal where you scribble ideas, draw rough diagrams etc. When you read that journal at a later time you will realise some of those 'bits' were germinal ideas leading to something significant.<br>

**Writing a research paper** : As I mentioned in an earlier passage, writing is difficult. When you will sit down to write about your research work, you will find yourself wanting for words and phrases to express yourself. This is what is called 'Writer's Block'. To tackle that I use Writer's 'Sturmtruppentaktik' (German for 'Storm troop tactics')

> Sturmtruppen or Storm troops were elite German shock troops whose main focus was speed and initiative. German army attacks would consist of Storm troopers bypassing serious resistance from enemy troops until they reached enemy artillery positions which were then neutralised. The regular troops would then mop of the enemy positions avoided by the Storm troops.

The tactic is as follows
1. Write all the headings and subheadigns you want to have in your paper. (First wave)
2. Then for each paragraph write a summary (in a few words) that tells you what the purpose of the paragraph is. (Second wave)
3. For each paragraph summary write three points you will mention in order to achieve the paragraph's   purpose.Avoid thinking about the English when you jot down the above points. Its ok if those points are linguistically crude. (Third wave)
4. Mopping up : Start expanding those points into coherent sentences (First draft of you paper is ready!!)

You should remember the first draft is the most time consuming and boring part of the research process. Using the above tactic you will be able to get over with it quickly. For more insights on writing research papers, I recommend watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AYxMbYZQ1Y) video from Microsoft Research.
