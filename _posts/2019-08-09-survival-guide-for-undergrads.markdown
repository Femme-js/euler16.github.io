Its been a long time since the last time I wrote something on this blog. I have had a lot of exciting stuff happening in my life in between. I graduated, got my first full paper selected at a major AI conference, did an internship with Adobe's Data Science team and worked on a really exciting new field (more on that later) and went on a solo tour to my home state at the end of it. As I write this post I am travelling again, this time to Jaipur for a weekend. For a while now, I have been retrospecting about how these four years of undergraduate life have gone by. Overall its been a sweet cocktail of highs and lows and I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in college. But I still remember the feeling of uncertainity that plagued me when I was a fresher, some lost opportunities and mistakes (and blunders :-) ) committed due to lack of knowledge related to undergraduate engineering. Now that I have finally left my college (and I also have some free time at my disposal), I think I can look back and examine my undergraduate years to derive some suggestions, cautions, advice etc. Things that I would tell a younger version of myself if I could go back in time. I summarize all of that in form of this **Survival Guide for Undergrads**.

## Disclaimer
I should make a few things clear in the begining.
1.  In no means is this guide complete. Part of the reason is that I don't think a complete undergraduate experience can be distilled into a single blog post. Its totally possible that I have made some serious omissions (graduates! you are welcome to point that out to me on mail!!). Consequently I might add a bunch of things at a later date. I

2. The ideas presented in this blog are based around my college experience and would be biased in some way. As much as I would like to include an allround perspective, its simply humanly impossible for me to do so. Since I am a computer engineer by education, you might find this blog a bit 'CS-ish'. Moreover some sections of this post are from an Indian engineering student's perspective.

3. Finally this is __my__ take on how to successfully wade through college life and certainly not the only one. You may very much disagree with my viewpoint and that is absolutely ok. But I hope you would find at least something that might be of use to you. 

> The post covers major issues faced throughout undergrad life such as internships, placements, MS preparation and Final year project. So even if you are not a fresher anymore, there are still somethings you will find useful. 

## How to approach your undergraduate life
Starting with your journey with college can be overwhelming and it is quite natural to think of it that way. After all when you emerge from the other end of undergrad life you would legally be an adult. The thought might be enough to spur you into worrying about internships, placements (or whatever you think you want to do after college) . Trust me this feeling is shared by most if not all freshers even if most wouldn't admit it. Here's what you should ideally be doing.

* **Relax and enjoy** : You have just entered college after a gruesome entrance preparation and you deserve a break. Don't worry about placements, internships at the onset. Trust me, anything you do in the name of preparation would be pretty insignificant in the larger scheme of things. So use this time to know the students joining with you make friends (as many as you can), go out and play etc. 

* **Explore! Explore! Explore!** : I can't stress this enough. 
* **Start a blog** :
* **Ask** : whom to ask?

## Academics

**Academic performance is important!**
**Do a project** <br>

**Final year project** <br>

**Result is not always proportional to effort**

## Internships, Placements from a CS perspective

### Preparing for Internships and Placements
**When should you start preparing from** <br>
**What should you focus on during preparation** <br>

> Competitve programming is not equal to Interview preparation

**Writing your resume**
### Structure of the interviews

### How to approach your internship

### Offcampus opportunities


## Undergraduate Research

###Expectations from undergraduate research**
**Keep a research journal** : <br>
**Writing a research paper** : The 'Sturmtruppentaktik' (German for 'Storm troop tactics')

> Sturmtruppen or Storm troops were elite German shock troops whose main focus was speed and initiative. German army attacks would consist of Storm troopers bypassing serious resistance from enemy troops until they reached enemy artillery positions which were then neutralised. The regular troops would then mop of the enemy positions avoided by the Storm troops.
