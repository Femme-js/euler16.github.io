Recurrent Neural Networks are amusing. They are amongst the finest examples of how simple mathematical models can achieve exciting and useful results. Recurrent Neural Networks (or RNNs for short) are a type of Neural Network architecture that are used for sequential data. That is inputs that occur as a sequence like language, audio, video frames. RNNs therefore the defacto models in these domains. These simple ( I would rather prefer the term 'cute') models are used to generate new language sequences, translate a sentence/document in one language to another, classify video and even play games!!!.
