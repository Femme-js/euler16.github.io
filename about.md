<p>I am currently a CS final year student at NSIT, University of Delhi.
<br>Broadly my interest lies in the domains of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science.
<br>In my spare time, I like to read about Modern Physics and AI. I am keenly interested in the theoretical foundations of AI.  I get super excited when I find that a certain concept native to one domain can solve a problem in some other unrelated domain. My dream is to be a part of the community of people working to solve intelligence.</p>
