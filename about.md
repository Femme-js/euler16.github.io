<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>I am currently a CS undergrad at NSIT Delhi.
<br>Broadly my interest lies in the domains of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science.
<br>My particular areas of interest include Deep Learning, Quantum Physics and Relativity. In my spare time, I like to read a lot about Modern Physics and AI. I am keenly interested in the theoretical foundations of AI.  I get super excited when I find that a certain concept native to one domain can solve a problem in some other unrelated domain. My dream is to be a part of the community of people working to solve intelligence.</p>
