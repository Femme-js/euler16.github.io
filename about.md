I am a final year undergraduate student of Computer Engineering department at Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology. My interests spans across Mathematics (specifically Stochastic Calculus), Deep Learning, Gradient free Optimization algorithms and Quantum Computing/Information Processing. During my undergraduate degree I managed to squeeze internships at a startup Zeg.ai and then at Samsung Research, Banglore where I worked on constructing Deep Nets for low power devices. At NSIT I worked in Dr. Vijander Singh's Control Engineering lab on Optimization problems. I am a [KVPY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kishore_Vaigyanik_Protsahan_Yojana) and [NTSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Talent_Search_Examination) scholar too.

Apart from mainstream academic work, I maintain this blog. I have also built a JavaScript library Qu.js (do ![check it out](https://github.com/euler16/Qu.js)!).

<h3>Talks</h3>
* [__Quantum Computing for Dummies!__](https://github.com/euler16/PyData-2018) : Presented at PyData-India Conference held in Delhi-11-12th August 2018.
* [__You Can Compress!__](https://github.com/euler16/PyData2017) : Presented as a co-speaker at PyData-India 2017. The talk was centered around popular dimensionality reduction methods used in Machine Learning.
<h3>Projects</h3>
* [__Qu.js__](https://github.com/euler16/Qu.js) : A JavaScript Quantum Computing framework that strives to be what Keras is for deep learning. Currently provides a local simulator, compilation to hardware specific Quantum languages (QUIL and QASM).
* [ __CharRNN__ ](https://github.com/euler16/CharRNN) : character based language modelling written in PyTorch.
* [ __Neural Style Transfer__ ](https://github.com/euler16/Neural-Style-Transfer) : implementation of the algorithm that is hallmark of interesection of art and AI.
* [ __Face-Recognize__ ](https://github.com/euler16/Face-Recognizer) : Face Recognition using Principal Component Analysis.
